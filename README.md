# Helsinki city bike app

This is an app made as a pre-assignment for applying to [Solita Dev Academy](https://www.solita.fi/positions/dev-academy-to-boost-your-software-developer-career-5427532003/). In addition of completing the pre-assignment, I also set two learning goals for this project. First was to improve my skills in TypeScript. Second was to improve my skills in frontend testing.

This is first app I have developed with TypeSript, before this I had aquired some basic knowledge on TypeScript from [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/)'s TypeScript [part](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part9). Although sometimes I regretted the decision to use somewhat unfamiliar technology in the development, I think that this decision also simulated a real world situation. A developer needs to be able to work with tehnology that they are not that familiar with and be able to learn while working with that technology. As an example for my work with JavaScript I suggest to check out my (unfinished) MTG Deck Builder(https://github.com/mikkohyy/mtg-deck-builders) app.

Both, frontend and backend of the app are located in the same reporitory. On more info on these sides of the apps and how to use or continue develpe them, navigate to [server](/server) directory or to [client](/client) directory. Other relevant parts are [things to fix in the future](things_to_be_fixed.md) and [instructions on how to use the app](instructions.md).
