# Things that should be fixed (in the future)

- In migrations I use any on umzug things since configuring umzug to work with typescript revealed to be somewhat difficult for me. Currently it works but kind of ignores TypeScript

- In frontend, using the explicitly defined setupProxy.js file is probably not the best way to do it. The reason why proxying was done with it is that I was not able to make setting up the proxy in the package.json file to work.
